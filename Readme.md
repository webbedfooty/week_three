In preparation for our work with databases, you'll create:

    Make a brand new project, with its own repository
    featuring a readme, a Rakefile, a Gemfile,
    a lib directory with a single class with
    3 or 4 attributes (plus getters, setters, and an initialize method),
    and a corresponding test file
    which tests getters and setters and nothing else

Don't get too attached to special logic in your setters, nor to your initialize method. Write the simplest code you can to complete this task.

Here is the file structure you should have:

- lib/
    - your_class.rb
- tests/
    - test_helper.rb
    - your_class_test.rb
- Gemfile
- Gemfile.lock
- Rakefile
- readme.markdown

(Replace your_class.rb and your_class_test.rb with your actual class file and the associated test file)
